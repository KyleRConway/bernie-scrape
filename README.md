**Purpose:** scrape sanders page for volunteer work

## Longer Background
The Sanders 2020 campaign was wildly open to volunteers and that meant that many volunteers were running seemingly large projects. I happened to volunteer to a video transcription service (basically adding subtitles to pre-vetted videos for social media).

Long story short, they couldn't give access to their internal list of videos and they'd just started up and people were already duplicating work. I wrote the script to quickly scrape everything live on the site and get it into a spreadsheet so people could confidently claim and work on a video. It's not perfect, but it was quick.
